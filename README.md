I'm [Virgil](https://github.com/virchan), an open source engineer with a focus on predictive analytics and practical machine learning. I enjoy turning research ideas into working systems and finding simple solutions to complex problems.

Currently freelancing in the San Francisco Bay Area, I work across industry projects, open-source, and independent consulting.

Previously, I did mathematical research in topology and earned my PhD from Purdue University.
